## Biography
I am interested in studying host-pathogen interactions to understand infection mechanisms of diseases in order to gain insights into the development of novel control and treatment approaches. I am especially keen to use ‘omics’ approaches and cell imaging technologies to understand mechanisms underlying pathogens' interaction with their host cells and tissues at different stages of infection in order to identify new targets for effective therapeutic strategies. I also have a strong interest in open science and reproducible research and thus, I desire to enhance my skills in data analysis and management tools that allow data to be stored, analyzed and shared in a way that promotes open science. Further, I am enthusiastic about mentoring young people in science to become creative and innovative thinkers in finding solutions to societal challenges.
